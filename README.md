# USS_to_Sound
 Takes input from an ultrasonic sensor and outputs a continuous sound, the volume of which depends on sensor reading.
Primary code is in US_to_Sound folder in the form of a .ino file. The US_to_led folder contains code that simply converts ultrasonic sensor input to LED output, used as a first draft to learn how to take USS input.
